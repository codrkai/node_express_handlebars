This tutorial steps through on setting up Node with Express Handlebars using the hbs framework. You will learn how to post form data and retrieve that data, as well as to return the data back to the client side. If you're looking to learn how routes, views, helpers, and components work together, then this is a good tutorial to follow. Watch my full tutorial video on youtube.
